# RegexAutomaton
RegexAutomaton is a web application designed to visualize the transformation of regular expressions into finite automata. The application allows users to input regular expressions and generates corresponding nondeterministic (NFA) and deterministic (DFA) finite automata. It also provides detailed visualizations and step-by-step explanations of the conversion process, making it a valuable tool for learning and analyzing regular expressions and automata theory.
